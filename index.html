<h3>What is Panjeshah-e-Vilayath-e-Ali A.S.?</h3>
<p>Panjesha-e-Vilayat-e-Ali A.S. is a sacred and spiritually honored shrine located near Kali Kaman, close to Gulzar House, in the Old City of Hyderabad, Telangana. The shrine is famous for the holy Panj-e-Mubarak (hand-mark) carved into a stone, symbolizing the divine authority, courage, and spiritual power of Hazrat Ali A.S. Devotees visit the shrine for ziyarat, prayers, blessings, and to feel a deep sense of peace and devotion.</p>

<div class="content">
<h3>History of the Shrine</h3>
<p>The shrine's significance is rooted in a famous historical legend from the era of Prophet Muhammad ﷺ. According to traditional belief, the sacred handprint comes from an incident during a journey when the Prophet ﷺ and his companions desperately needed water. They discovered a well, but jinns living inside it prevented anyone from drawing water by snatching and throwing back every vessel lowered into it.</p>
<p>When all companions failed, Hazrat Ali A.S. stepped forward. The jinns attempted to stop him as well, but his righteous anger rose. He placed his blessed hands on the stone boundary of the well and jumped inside. The stone softened like clay under his hands, leaving behind the holy handprint that is now honored as the Panjesha.</p>
<p>Inside the well, Hazrat Ali A.S. fought the jinns, defeated them, purified the well, and brought water for the Prophet ﷺ and his companions. This powerful event is remembered as Jang-e-Bairul Ilm, symbolizing Hazrat Ali's unmatched bravery and spiritual authority. This sacred handprint is the heart of the shrine's identity and reverence in Hyderabad.</p>

<h3>BARGAH-E-PANJESHAH-E-VILAYAT</h3>
<div class="history-section">
<p>This Bargah is named after the palm impression of Nafs-e-Rasool, Saqi-e-Kousar, Asadullah Nafsullah, Abul Hasan, Abuturab Ameer-ul-Momineen Hazrat Ali Ibne Abutalib (A.S.). The history of this palm impression is extracted from Manaqib Ibne Ashoob-II pg. 90 and Kanzul Vaizeen Mullah Saleh Barghani by Imam-ul-Muhaqequeen Alhaj Mohd. Taqi Qurduni by quotations of Imam Hasan-e-Askari (A.S.) that Rasool Allah passed through a lone valley after the battle of Sakarsak.</p>
<div class="historical-event">
<h4>The Miraculous Event</h4>
<p>Prophet asked Omer bin Umayya Zamri, "Do you know this place?" Umayya Zamri replied, "This place is known as the valley of Kaisaba-e-Azaq; there is a well in which lives a genie on whom Hazrat Suleman could not have control. Once the army of Yemen passed this valley but all the 10,000 soldiers were killed." Prophet said, "If it is so, then stop the caravan." Ten people were sent to fetch water from the well.</p>
<p>When the people came nearer to the well, a fierce demon (Afriat) came out of the well and gave a terrible shout in such a way that the whole forest was put on fire. At this moment Jibraeel came towards Rasool Allah and said, "Oh Prophet! Give the alarm to Hazrat Ali (A.S.) and send him." Hazrat Ali (A.S.) reached the well again. The fierce demon came out. He again cried in a terrible manner. Then Moula said, "I am Ali Ibne Abu Talib. My intention is to perish the disbelievers of Allah." After listening to these words the demon attacked.</p>
</div>
<div class="victory-section">
<h4>The Victory of Hazrat Ali (A.S.)</h4>
<p>Having defended the demon's attack, Hazrat Ali raised his sword (Zulfiqar) and killed the demon. When the demon (Afriat) was killed, fire blazed out of the well; many fierce faces also appeared. Asadullah said, "Baradaan wa Salaman," and read the holy verses of Qur'an. The fire was put off.</p>
<p>Hazrat Ali tried to take out water from the well but the bucket was thrown out of the well. Thrice the bucket was thrown. At last Hazrat Ali decided to tie a rope to his waist and get in the well. A rope was tied to the waist and Hazrat Ali (A.S.) stepped into the well. Suddenly the rope broke and all the people felt afraid and started crying.</p>
</div>
<div class="miracle-section">
<h4>The Miraculous Conversion</h4>
<p>After a while Ashab could listen to the shouting that they were begging for life: "Ya Ali, leave us!" Hazrat Ali (A.S.) asked them to recite Kalmah and get freed. The genie recited Kalmah, embraced Islam and were freed. A rope was put into the well and Hazrat Ali (A.S.) came out after relieving 20,000 genie and making 20,000 genie tribes Muslim. Huzoor-e-Akram hugged Hazrat Ali (A.S.) and kissed his forehead. After staying for a night they went to Madina. In the history of Islam this battle is known as Battle of "Beerul Alam."</p>
</div>
<div class="relic-section">
<h4>The Sacred Relic</h4>
<p>When Hazrat Ali (A.S.) was getting into the well he kept his hands on the sides and the stones were impressed by his palm. This impressioned stone was along with Mir Amanullah Razvi Najafi in Iraq.</p>
<p>When Abdullah Qutub Shah during his reign in Hyderabad came to know about this Panje Mubarak, he took help of Shahane Safavi to get this sacred relic to Hyderabad. The King Safawi sent Haji Mir Danwesh Ali Razvi Najafi, nephew of Mir Amanullah Razvi Najafi, to Hyderabad with the Panja-e-Mubarak. The King Abdullah Qutubshah warmly welcomed the Panja-e-Mubarak and constructed a building and made Haji Mir Darwesh Ali Razvi Najafi the Mutawalli.</p>
</div>
<div class="succession-section">
<h4>Continuing Legacy</h4>
<p>Alhamdulillah till today Towlaiat is still continued in his family. Mir Imam Ali Razvi Najafi, Mir Turab Ali Razvi Najafi, Mir Ali Imam Razvi Najafi are VIII, IX, X successors respectively.</p>
<p>At present Mir Ali Imam Razvi Najafi (Azher) is the Mutawalli of Panjeshah-e-Vilayath.</p>
</div>
<div class="artifacts-section">
<h4>Sacred Artifacts</h4>
<p>In this Dargah there is an iron chain, iron plates and Kashta presented by Mir Mahmood Sahab Qibla. This Kashta is taken out only on the day of Sandal and Sandal-e-Mubarak is kept in it.</p>
